        My latest project, -A..0PP。LoE--..<br><br>
        Using p5.riso.js, I created a unique and captivating texture that I applied to a painting of an apple. The texture is completely random, with each color, shape, and dither type generated through the power of chance. This process imbues the work with a sense of unpredictability and adds a touch of playfulness that makes the piece feel alive.<br><br>
        Through this project, I wanted to explore the connections between the organic form of the apple and the artificial texture I created. By juxtaposing these two elements, I hoped to provoke a dialogue about our relationship with nature and technology.<br><br>
        In -A..0PP。LoE--., I see an expression of the beauty and complexity of the natural world, while also acknowledging the impact that technology has on our lives. It's a cute and playful exploration of the ways in which we interact with the world around us, and I hope it inspires viewers to question their own relationship with technology and the environment.
